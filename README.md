# Keras-Image-Classification
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification

A machine learning project to classify images with categories of buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street using labelled images from Kaggle.

Originally a Keras model project but the same model is implemented using PyTorch (torch_model.py and torch_main.py) for learning purposes.
